# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Universal Converter is a web-based utility that provides quick and easy conversions between various units, currencies, and time zones. The application will serve as a comprehensive conversion tool accessible through a web browser, prioritizing accuracy, speed, and user experience. This web version will later be adapted into a macOS desktop application using Electron.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert between different units of measurement, so that I can quickly translate values for work, study, or personal use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a unit category THEN the system SHALL display all available units within that category
2. WHEN I enter a numeric value in the input field THEN the system SHALL convert it in real-time to the selected target unit
3. WHEN I select different source and target units THEN the system SHALL update the conversion result immediately
4. IF I enter invalid input THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and prevent conversion
5. WHEN I perform a conversion THEN the system SHALL display results with appropriate precision (up to 10 decimal places)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler or business professional, I want to convert currencies with live exchange rates, so that I can make informed financial decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the currency converter THEN the system SHALL fetch current exchange rates from a reliable API
2. WHEN I enter an amount and select currencies THEN the system SHALL display the converted amount in real-time
3. WHEN exchange rates are updated THEN the system SHALL display the timestamp of the last update
4. IF the system cannot fetch live rates THEN the system SHALL use cached rates and indicate they may be outdated
5. WHEN I select a currency THEN the system SHALL support major world currencies and common trading pairs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As someone working across time zones, I want to convert times between different time zones, so that I can schedule meetings and coordinate activities globally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select source and target time zones THEN the system SHALL display the current time in both zones
2. WHEN I enter a specific date and time THEN the system SHALL convert it accurately to the target time zone
3. WHEN daylight saving time applies THEN the system SHALL automatically account for DST rules
4. WHEN I search for a time zone THEN the system SHALL provide quick filtering and selection options
5. IF I select an invalid date/time THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can perform conversions quickly without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the application THEN the system SHALL display within 2 seconds on modern browsers
2. WHEN I interact with input fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and updates
3. WHEN I want to copy results THEN the system SHALL provide a clear copy-to-clipboard function
4. WHEN I use the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt responsively
5. WHEN I prefer dark mode THEN the system SHALL support dark/light theme switching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be fully accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
2. WHEN I use screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
3. WHEN I need larger text THEN the system SHALL support adjustable font sizes
4. WHEN I have color vision differences THEN the system SHALL not rely solely on color for information
5. WHEN I use assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably even with poor internet connectivity, so that I can perform basic conversions offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads initially THEN the system SHALL cache essential conversion data locally
2. WHEN internet connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue to perform unit conversions using cached data
3. WHEN currency data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the age of exchange rates
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically update cached data
5. IF critical data cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer or power user, I want the application to be performant and efficient, so that it doesn't slow down my workflow or consume excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform conversions THEN the system SHALL complete calculations in under 100ms
2. WHEN the application is idle THEN the system SHALL use minimal CPU and memory resources
3. WHEN I switch between conversion types THEN the system SHALL respond immediately without delays
4. WHEN data is fetched from APIs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching and rate limiting
5. WHEN multiple users access the application THEN the system SHALL maintain performance under reasonable load
